            <p>Our program aims to allow students who are passionate about issues surrounding sustainability and green technology to discover, problem-solve and explore through an interdisciplinary approach, and at the same time understand the challenges and constraints of sustainability, along with the opportunities that come along with it.</p>

                    Our enrichment program brings in speakers from multiple disciplines to share their take on sustainability, so that the students will get a balanced and broad view of issues surrounding sustainability. The enrichment program also exposes students to cutting-edge (green) technology and brings them on learning journeys to explore how industries and organisations move towards sustainable practices. Finally, the programme provides students with the opportunity to learn interactively through hands-on activities and games. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In our enrichment program, we explored the concepts of sustainability and green technology through the following lens â€“ science, economics, geography, sociology and many more.

                        <li>Elective seminar, where students are tasked to perform research on a given topic of sustainability and conduct a 50 min session to educate the class about what they have researched in through their presentation and facilitated activities</li>
                        <li>Sustainable City Capstone Project, where students consolidate what the students have learnt about the strengths and limitations of green technology and the constraints and trade-offs surrounding their use to achieve sustainability. Students will need to design a poster that explains how they plan to make the city they have chosen more sustainable and to model or prototype a key green technology that will enable the city to become greener</li>
